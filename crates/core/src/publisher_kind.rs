//! `PublisherKind` — the single source of truth for anodizer's publisher
//! vocabulary.
//!
//! Every publisher anodizer knows is one variant here. The whole release
//! tool derives its publisher-keyed sets from this one enum via **exhaustive
//! `match`** (no `_ =>` wildcard), so adding a publisher fails to compile
//! until every derivation has been taught about it:
//!
//! - [`PublisherKind::token`] — the canonical, lowercase selector token
//!   (the same string [`crate::Publisher::name`] returns, the one
//!   `--publishers` and `--skip` key on).
//! - [`PublisherKind::is_publish_stage`] — the explicit per-variant predicate
//!   that distinguishes the trait-dispatched publishers (instantiable as a
//!   `Box<dyn Publisher>` in `stage-publish`'s registry) from the
//!   out-of-dispatch *publish stages* (`blob`, `snapcraft-publish`, `docker`,
//!   `docker-sign`, `announce`) that fire their irreversible publish from a
//!   pipeline stage instead. This replaces the former hand-maintained
//!   `PUBLISH_STAGE_PUBLISHERS` list.
//!
//! The publisher portion of [`crate::context::valid_release_skips`] and
//! `stage-publish`'s `valid_publisher_names` / `all_publishers` are all driven
//! off [`PublisherKind::iter`], so the `--skip` / `--publishers` vocabulary
//! and the trait registry can never drift from this enum again.
//!
//! Lives in `anodizer-core` (not `stage-publish`) because
//! [`crate::context`] needs the publisher tokens to assemble the `--skip`
//! vocabulary, and `core` must not depend on `stage-publish`. The reverse
//! mapping — variant → concrete `Publisher` impl — lives in
//! `stage-publish`'s registry, where the concrete types are visible.
