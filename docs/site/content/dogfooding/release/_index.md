# Release pipeline

The keys that drive the release itself: GitHub/GitLab/Gitea release surface,
changelog generation, announcers, cloud uploads, and custom publishers.

## Release and changelog

| Key | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|

## Announcers

13 channels implemented. Two are exercised by live cfgd releases; the
others have full test coverage but no live secrets configured.

| Key | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `announce.webhook` | ✅ Verified | [cfgd `.anodizer.yaml`](https://github.com/tj-smith47/cfgd/blob/master/.anodizer.yaml) (`announce.webhook.endpoint_url: https://tj.jarvispro.io/webhooks/anodizer`) |
| `announce.smtp` | ✅ Verified | [cfgd `.anodizer.yaml`](https://github.com/tj-smith47/cfgd/blob/master/.anodizer.yaml) (`announce.smtp.host: smtp.gmail.com`) |
| `announce.discord` | 🤝 Help wanted | No live workflow has the secrets |
| `announce.slack` | 🤝 Help wanted | No live workflow has the secrets |
| `announce.telegram` | 🤝 Help wanted | No live workflow has the secrets |
| `announce.teams` | 🤝 Help wanted | No live workflow has the secrets |
| `announce.mattermost` | 🤝 Help wanted | No live workflow has the secrets |
| `announce.reddit` | 🤝 Help wanted | No live workflow has the secrets |
| `announce.twitter` | 🤝 Help wanted | No live workflow has the secrets |
| `announce.mastodon` | 🤝 Help wanted | No live workflow has the secrets |

| `announce.opencollective` | 🤝 Help wanted | No live workflow has the secrets |
| `announce.discourse` | 🤝 Help wanted | No live workflow has the secrets |

## Blob and artifactory uploads

| Key | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `blobs[]` (S3 / GCS / Azure) | 🤝 Help wanted | `object_store` SDK wired. No release configures cloud credentials |
| `artifactories[]` | 🤝 Help wanted | Target, mode, TLS, headers wired; no live deployment |
| `uploads[]` | 🤝 Help wanted | Generic HTTP upload wired; no live deployment |
| `furies[]` | 🤝 Help wanted | Implemented; no live credentials |
| `cloudsmiths[]` | 🤝 Help wanted | Wired in [cfgd's config](https://github.com/tj-smith47/cfgd/blob/master/.anodizer.yaml) with a live `CLOUDSMITH_TOKEN`; uploads currently fail at HTTP layer so no package has landed in the `jarvispro/cfgd` repo. Awaiting endpoint debug |

## Custom publishers

| Key | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `publishers[]` | ✅ Verified | [`crates/cli/src/commands/publisher.rs`](https://github.com/tj-smith47/anodizer/blob/master/crates/cli/src/commands/publisher.rs) (custom command per artifact) |

## MCP registry

Final GoReleaser parity item. Publishes an MCP server manifest to
`https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io`.

The implementation is feature-complete with unit-test coverage of every branch
(auth providers, retry policy, dry-run, repository inference). Dogfooding is
**held**: anodizer's own `.anodizer.yaml` declares `packages[0].registry_type: oci`
with `identifier: ghcr.io/tj-smith47/anodizer`, but the project ships binary
archives and does not yet have a `dockers:` block. Publishing this manifest
today would point MCP clients at a 404, so the `mcp:` block is marked
`skip: true` until either (a) Plan A's MCP server image ships via a `dockers:`
entry, or (b) the package is pivoted to a registry type the project actually
distributes.

|---|---|---|
| `mcp.name` | 🤝 Help wanted | Wired in [anodizer `.anodizer.yaml`](https://github.com/tj-smith47/anodizer/blob/master/.anodizer.yaml); blocked on `dockers:` block / first live publish |

| `mcp.auth.type: github` | 🤝 Help wanted | [`crates/stage-publish/src/mcp/auth.rs`](https://github.com/tj-smith47/anodizer/blob/master/crates/stage-publish/src/mcp/auth.rs) (PAT exchange branch) — unit-tested; blocked on `dockers:` block before dogfood publish |
